# _Introduction_

In out final project for Data 603 - Statistical Modelling with Data, we have tried to develop a model to analyze the impact of various demographic and social factors on the performance of students. Academic performance, though it is not the only factor but is one of the crucial factors in shaping a student's future. To get into a good collage/university, student must score grades in school, a good college ca lead a better future and economic stability. So in order to secure good grades, getting into a great school is enough? Is there something more than a great school that can help a student to perform better? Do the social and demographic factors plays any role in student's performance? In our project we are trying to answer these question.

To answer these questions we are working with a dataset that is collected at 2 Portuguese schools for Mathematics and Portuguese subject. This data is collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The data attribute include students grades, family size information, education level of parents, free time of student, any many other factors. By working on this project we are hoping to develop more understanding about the factors which can impact the performance of a student.
